### 3) Move SDK into /opt (requires sudo) ###

    echo "Failed to move Vulkan SDK to /opt. Check permissions."

# (Optional) Ensure /opt/vulkan-sdk directory is owned by root
# but typically that is fine so that normal users can read from it.
sudo chown -R root:root "/opt/vulkan-sdk-${VULKAN_SDK_VERSION}"

### 4) Append environment variables to your userâ€™s ~/.zshrc ###
# This is the crucial step to ensure that your normal user picks up the environment
# changes each time you open a new shell.

ZSHRC="${HOME}/.zshrc"

# Check if .zshrc exists, if not, create it
if [ ! -f "$ZSHRC" ]; then
